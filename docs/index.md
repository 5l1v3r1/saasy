# SaaSy Development Framework
ASP.NET Core 2.2 SaaS development framework for minimal viable product and proof of concept sites.
## Goals
The primary goal for the SaaSy Framework is to provide a starting point for a SaaS application. 
If your project is looking at a distributed micoservices architecture, this is not the project. If, on the other hand,
you are happy with a monolith type application or are intending to use SaaSy Framework as the core and bolt on other
services then this is the project for you!

The primary aim of SaaSy is to get small SaaS ideas to market as quickly as possible, without sacrificing security or productivity.
